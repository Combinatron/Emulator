# Emulator
A software implementation of the abstract machine defined at
[Combinatron/Specification](https://github.com/Combinatron/Specification).

This is currently only a working prototype and may have bugs. It should be good
enough to play around with though.

## Contributing

You can use Nix and `nix-shell` to get a working environment that can be messed
around in.

## Todo

- Make easier to contribute
- Clean up code
